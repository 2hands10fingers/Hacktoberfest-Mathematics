### Mathematics Folder/File Structure
**Implementing new File/Directory Structure**
* Try to keep things as modular as possible, the new file/directory structure should be: 
```
/area_of_mathematics/general_formula/formula/language/file
ex: /algebra/distance_formula/3d_distance_formula/java/3d_distance_formula.java
```
